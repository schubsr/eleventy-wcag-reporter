#### Problem

Focus styles have been removed through the website's stylesheets:

```css
* { 
  outline: none 
}
```

This causes problems for people who use the webite without a mouse, as they will not be able to see where they are.

#### Solution

Remove the `outline: none` rule, and/or add a specific style that applies on `:focus`. Make sure that it has sufficient contrast, too.
